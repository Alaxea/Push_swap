## PUSH_SWAP

The Push Swap project aims to teach sorting <sup>algorithms</sup> and memory management in the C programming language. The goal is to implement a sorting algorithm that uses two stacks (A and B) to sort an array of integers. During the project, I became familiar with various sorting methods, such as bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, as well as more advanced algorithms like Quick Sort and Merge Sort. Additionally, I had to evaluate the time and space complexity of the algorithm, which helped me understand the efficiency of different approaches.

### Troubleshooting
In case of error, it must display "Error" followed by a ’\n’ on the standard error. Errors include for example: some arguments aren’t integers, some arguments are bigger than an integer and/or there are duplicates.

### Usage

- Clone the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:Alaxea/Push_swap.git
```
- To compile the program, run the following command:
```
make
```
- To execute the program, use the following command:
```
./push swap [numbers to sort]
```
